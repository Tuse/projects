This is code for a software defined network, simulated via mininet.

An arbiter receives demands from one or more hosts on the network, and allocates a path (denoted by a vlan tag) as well as a time slot in which hosts can transmit this traffic. 

These allocations are sent back to the host, who will then transmit accordingly.

TCP communications are utilized between each host and the arbiter, while transmissions between hosts are performed via raw sockets (using libtins) in order to add the vlan tag.

Python scripts are used to setup Mininet and install routing rules in the virtual switches.
